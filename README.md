This code is written in Processing. Run it using the processing application.
The setup generates a grid of vectors, that map to the pixels of the canvas, with their directions sampled from the 2D perlin noise function. Draw allows the user to drop particles on the screen with a mouse click. The vectors are applied to the particles as a force, pushing them accross the screen, leaving a coloured trail behind them as they move. There are buttons to select the colour of the trails.
Play with the global variables defined at the beginning of the program to find an aesthetically pleasing combination.
The word document is a full write up detailing the concept, development and testing processes.
